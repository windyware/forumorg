[![Maintainability](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/15ea52785113c7b99f74/maintainability)](https://codeclimate.com/github/ForumOrganisation/forumorg/maintainability)

This is the repository of [Forum Organisation](https://www.forumorg.org)'s official website.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get help get your own copy of the project running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

#### Install
First, you will need [Docker CE](https://docs.docker.com/install/) installed in your machine.

To check if it's been installed correctly, run `docker --version && docker-compose --version` and see if it returns something like this:

```sh
Docker version 17.09.0-ce, build afdb6d4
docker-compose version 1.16.1, build 6d1ac21
```

### Run
In order to run this project, checkout this github repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ForumOrganisation/forumorg.git
```

And fill the following environment variables in a `.env` file at the root of the project:

```sh
BUCKET_NAME="bucket_name" # Required: S3 bucket name
SENDGRID_API_KEY="sendgrid_key" # Optional: for emailing events
RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY="recaptcha_key" # Optional: for recaptcha forms
```

To start the application, run `docker-compose up -d` and your app should be deployed at http://localhost:5000 !

If you want to access the terminal input/output of the application:

```sh
docker exec -ti $(docker ps | grep web | awk '{print $1}') sh
```

Note: for access to logs, run `docker-compose logs -f web`

You're now ready to write some code, your changes should be reflected in the application :) !

### Deploy

#### Heroku
The application is currently deployed on Heroku.

The Heroku Command Line Interface (CLI) makes it easy to create and manage your Heroku apps directly from the terminal.
Itâ€™s an essential part of using Heroku. Install it by following [these guidelines](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install).

Heroku can be set to recognize your working app directory as the deployed heroku app(s), by adding the following git remotes:

```sh
git remote add production https://git.heroku.com/forumorg-prod.git
git remote add staging https://git.heroku.com/forumorg-staging.git
```

#### Deployment process
On ```any pull request``` ([see how](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)):
- A temporary review app is created, which can be live tested.
- If everything is working OK, the PR can be merged into `master`.

On ```push to master```:
- A build is triggered on our [staging app](https://forumorg-staging.herokuapp.com) (useful for testing in a production-like environment).

On ```heroku pipelines:promote -r staging --to production```:
- The staging app is instantly deployed to [production](https://www.forumorg.org).

## Running scripts
Some tasks on the platform requires one-off execution of scripts, like batch updates performed in database.

You can execute a script by adding it to **manage.py** as a python function, then run:

```sh
heroku local:run python manage.py my_script
```

## Localization
The app is localized using:

- Flask-Babel: used to indicate which strings needs to be translated (surrounded with `_('STRING')`)
- PhraseApp: provides a nice UI to translate the strings

You can get familiar with the process [by following this tutorial](https://phraseapp.com/blog/posts/python-localization-flask-applications/).
